# Demo-repo
1)
Hi! This is my first Repository
<br>
Commit- This is like a save changes option.
<br>
Besides every repo, there will be the name of the last committed repo which is the "History Tracking" feature.
<br>
2)
I just changed something which will make the status different than before.
This will display all the edited files as "modified" and all the local,newly created files as "untracked"
<br>
3)Now even after committing in our local system, the main git won't be updated/synced. For that we need to use the "push" command.
